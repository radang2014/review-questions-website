What is printed?",MC,"Person x = new Ryan();
x.speak();",,<code>Hello!</code>,,<code>My name is Ryan!</code>,,<code>Hello!</code> followed by <code>My name is Ryan!</code>,,This code would not compile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2

4,All of the following are true statements about iterators in Java EXCEPT...,MC,,,The use of external iterators exposes details about data structure implementation.,,Using iterators for a data structure uses more heap memory than traversing a data structure directly.,,"When an iterator and data structure implement the necessary methods, the following syntactic sugar can be used: <code>for (Object elem : elems) {}</code>",,A data structure traversed by an <code>Iterator</code> should implement the <code>Iterable</code> interface.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1

7,"Suppose that <code>m</code> is a <code>Method</code> object representing an instance method. Typically, that method would be invoked with <code>m.invoke(Object receiver, Object [] args)</code>.
