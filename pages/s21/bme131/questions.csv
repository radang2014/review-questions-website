1,"Marie and Pierre Curie, wife and husband, won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1903, but only Marie won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1911. Why did Pierre not also receive the Nobel Prize for Chemistry?",MC,,,Pierre's contribution was deemed not significant enough.,,"Pierre focused entirely on physics, while Marie did a substantial amount of work in both Physics and Chemistry.",,Pierre tragically passed away between 1903 and 1911.,,Marie's just built different.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3
2,"The pressure of ultrasound waves is continuous across the boundary between two media. Let \(p_i\) be the pressure of the wave incident on such a boundary, \(p_t\) be the pressure of the transmitted wave, and \(p_r\) be the pressure of the reflected wave. Assuming that the wave is propagating at an angle normal to the boundary, which of the following equations is true?",MC,,,\(p_i = p_t + p_r\),,\(p_t = p_i + p_r\),,\(p_r = p_i + p_t\),,\(p_i + p_r + p_t = 0\),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2
