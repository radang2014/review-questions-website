1,Density is defined as...,MC,,force/area,,weight/volume,,mass/volume,,mass/molarity,,energy/mass*temperature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3
2,The scientist credited with the discovery of the nucleus (of the atom) is...,MC,,Democritus,,J.J. Thompson,,Robert Millikan,,Ernest Rutherford,,Stephanie Bertenshaw,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4
3,"In any chemical reaction that goes to completion, the reactant that gets used up is called the...",MC,,Normal Reactant,,Excess Reactant,,Limiting Reactant,,Weird Reactant,,Cheap Reactant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3
4,In an endothermic reaction...,MC,,An odd number of electrons get transferred,,An even number of electrons get transferred,,The change in enthalpy is positive,,The change in enthalpy is negative,,Hess's Law no longer applies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3
5,Our atmosphere is primarily which gas?,MC,,Hydrogen,,Helium,,Oxygen,,Carbon Dioxide,,Nitrogen,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5
6,In a state of dynamic equilibrium...,MC,,The forward reaction rate is higher than the reverse reaction rate,,The forward reaction rate is lower than the reverse reaction rate,,All reaction rates are 0,,The forward reaction rate is equivalent to the reverse reaction rate,,The chemical reaction goes to completion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4
7,According to Erwin Schrodinger's quantum theory...,MC,,Electrons are always in fixed locations within the orbital,,Electrons move around in the orbital at extremely fast speeds,,"Electrons split into many pieces, occupying the entire orbital",,"A single electron is everywhere in the orbital, with different probability densities",,\(s\) orbitals reign supreme over other orbitals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4
8,A molecule with a central atom having 5 single bonds and 1 lone pair has what molecular geometry?,MC,,Trigonal bipyramidal,,Trigonal planar,,Octahedral,,Square Planar,,Square Pyramidal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5
9,The product of the concentration of \(H_3O^+\) ions in an aqueous solution and the concentration of \(OH^-\) ions at \(25\) \(^{\circ} C\) is always...,MC,,\(6.022 \times 10^{23}\),,\(1\),,\(0\),,\(1 \times 10^{-14}\),,\(6.626 \times 10^{-34}\),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4
10,Why does vapor pressure decrease when solute is added to water?,MC,,Osmotic pressure causes more liquid water to be present in the solution,,Water vapor is attracted to the solute,,The volume of the container spontaneously decreases,,"Attractive forces between water vapor molecules decrease, making the gas more ideal",,None of the above,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5
